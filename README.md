# ENCM 515 -- W2022
Code sketches for ENCM 515

This repository is intended to collate the various code sketches that we'll develop over the course of ENCM 515 lectures, etc.

There's no guarantee that anything works. 

## Dependencies

* for the Jupyter notebooks, you should have python3 installed, plus Jupyter and all its dependencies. I used the setup instructions from [ThinkDSP](https://github.com/AllenDowney/ThinkDSP). On my own machine, I first set up a Python virtual environment (e.g., `python3 -m venv venv`, then `source venv/bin/activate`). 

* folks on M1 Macs will likely need to work out how to get the x86-64 version of stuff running under Rosetta 2. From memory, I did this by installing iTerm 2, going to Applications, get-info-ing the app and then selecting `Open using Rosetta`. I think I then went to [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) and followed the instructions there to install Homebrew, and then through Homebrew, python3.
